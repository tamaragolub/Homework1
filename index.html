        <p> What can I say about me? Let's just say that I am hard to forget. I am a fun, and outgoing person. I
            love a challenge. I am always learning something new. I love photography and music. I have two children: a
            boy and a girl, and I dedicate all my time to them. </p>

        <p>A little about my background: I was born in Ukraine. I came to America when I was 5 years old, and grew
            up in Portland, OR. When I was 18, I moved to Charlotte, NC and have lived here since then. I love living
            here. It is a beautiful, fast-paced, growing city. </p>

        <p>I am really excited about this course. So far, it has been a challenge, but in a good way. All good
            things take time to develop. But how I know that I enjoy it, not only from my inner excitement, but becuase
            I do not dread waking up early just to come to class!! </p>
